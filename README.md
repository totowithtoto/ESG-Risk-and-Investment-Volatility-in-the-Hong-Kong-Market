# ESG Risk and Investment Volatility in the Hong Kong Market
## Abstract
This study examines the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance and stock price volatility in the Hong Kong market from 2020 to 2023. 

We analyze companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, using Morningstar ESG risk scores as the independent variable and share price volatility as the dependent variable. Our multilinear regression analysis reveals substantial correlations (RÂ² > 40%) across sectors, particularly in Consumer Defensive, Communication Services, and Utilities sector. Recent regulatory changes have positively influenced ESG performance amongst Hong Kong listed companies. 

This study underscores the importance of sector-specific analyses and regulatory impacts, providing insights for policymakers and corporations in integrating ESG considerations into financial decision-making.

## Introduction
The ESG investment market has seen significant growth, with a net inflow of US$29 billion in early 2023, representing 30% of total assets globally. ESG investing incorporates environmental, social, and governance factors to enhance investment decisions, recognizing their influence on a company's risk and opportunities. While ESG integration aims to manage investment risks and improve returns, the relationship between ESG performance and corporate financial outcomes can be complex.

## Hypothesis and Methodology
We hypothesize that higher ESG performance in the Hong Kong market correlates with better control over investment risks. This study utilizes multilinear regression to analyze the relationship between ESG risk scores and share price volatility, considering control variables such as profitability, financial leverage, and company size. We also investigate sector-specific sensitivities to ESG factors and regulatory influences on ESG performance.

## Data Collection
Data for 150 companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange was collected, focusing on:
### Price Volatility: Measured as the standard deviation of daily stock price changes.
### ESG Risk Scores: Sourced from Morningstar, reflecting a company's ESG risk exposure and management effectiveness.
### Control Variables: Includes leverage (total debt/invested capital), profitability (return on invested capital), and company size (number of employees).

## Data Analysis and Discussion

![Sector Distribution](Figure%201/Sector_Distribution.png)

Our analysis indicates that non-service sectors have higher ESG risk scores, particularly in Energy and Utilities. A downward trend in ESG risk scores from 2020 to 2023 suggests improved ESG management in response to regulatory changes. We observe that while higher ESG risk scores correlate with increased volatility in some sectors, others, like Consumer Defensive, exhibit a negative correlation, indicating a complex relationship.

## Conclusion
This study highlights the nuanced relationship between ESG performance and investment volatility across sectors. While ESG practices can enhance risk management, their effects vary by industry. Understanding these dynamics is essential for investors and policymakers as they navigate the complexities of integrating ESG considerations into financial strategies.
